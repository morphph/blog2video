# Launch Stage

*From: The Founder's Playbook — Building an AI-Native Startup (Anthropic). Chapter 5.*

If the MVP stage was about proving your product deserves to exist, the Launch stage is about proving your business deserves to grow.

## Launch stage goals

In the Launch stage, startup founders must **turn early traction into a repeatable, sustainable growth engine**. Beyond making your product production-ready, you also must harden the infrastructure underneath it while simultaneously building an actual company around your product.

Startups are naturally founder-centric during the Idea and MVP stages because you need the full situational awareness and tight feedback loops. Now, though, founders who still try to personally hold every thread become a Launch stage bottleneck. The goal isn't to remove yourself from the company, but to **build operational systems that free your attention** for the decisions only a founder can make.

## Launch stage exit criteria

The Launch stage exit condition has three elements:

1. **Growth is repeatable and channel-driven.** You're not just retaining users, you're acquiring them predictably through specific channels with understood unit economics: CAC, LTV, and payback period are numbers you know and can defend.
2. **The product can handle production workloads.** Infrastructure is hardened, security and compliance are in order, and reliability holds under real production conditions (not just the conditions you tested for).
3. **Operations run without founder bottlenecks.** Processes exist and automation is in place. You are no longer the person personally handling support, triage, sprint planning, or reporting.

## Launch stage challenges

Finding product-market fit is the hardest problem in the early startup lifecycle. Now, the founder's challenge becomes keeping it. The Launch stage is where companies that found real product traction may still fall apart if the organization that surrounds and supports the product can't keep up. These are the failure modes to watch for.

### Technical debt comes due

**The challenge:** The MVP codebase built for speed and validation ran well enough to prove the product worked, but production traffic, new features, and growing complexity are now exposing the shortcuts.

At MVP, accumulating some technical debt was a reasonable tradeoff for velocity. In the Launch phase, that debt starts accruing interest, and the longer it goes unaddressed, the more expensive it is to fix.

The solution consists of a systematic architectural audit to identify structural weaknesses, targeted refactoring to address the worst of them, and a meaningful expansion of test coverage so that the next round of feature work doesn't reintroduce the same problems.

### The founder becomes the bottleneck

**The challenge:** At MVP, the founder being in every loop was an asset. At Launch, as support volume grows, product decisions stack up, and operational complexity multiplies, that same instinct becomes the constraint.

The transition from doing the work to designing the systems that do the work is one of the hardest shifts in the startup lifecycle. Because there's rarely a clear moment when it happens, the risk is to miss it entirely and stay in builder mode while the organization stalls around you. Telltale signs that this is happening include decisions that should take an hour now take a week for you to get around to them, support requests that pile up because only you know the answer, and operational tasks that only happen when you personally remember to do them.

The remedy is an all-out audit of everything you're personally handling, from the tiniest task to the most high-stakes decisions, in order to identify what can be systematized, what can be delegated, and what genuinely still merits founder time and attention.

### Security and compliance are no longer deferrable

**The challenge:** Keeping security and compliance measures simple was OK for MVP but now, with real users, real data, and potentially enterprise contracts on the table, it becomes a liability.

At MVP, with a handful of beta users and no sensitive data in production, security vulnerabilities were theoretical risks. The hypothetical, however, becomes very real exposure risk the moment your product enters production with real users depending on it. Furthermore, compliance requirements that didn't apply to a prototype definitely apply the moment you're handling customer data, processing payments, or selling into regulated industries.

The remedy is a systematic security and compliance review before production scale arrives, not after, and treat everything that surfaces as a required remediation—not a suggestion—before the next wave of users arrives.

### Expansion before you're ready

**The challenge:** New markets and funding opportunities look like growth opportunities. They can also be where product-market fit goes to die.

The initial traction you've built is real, but it's also specific to your early audience. Expanding too early into a market that's meaningfully different from your original one introduces new user behaviors, compliance requirements, payment infrastructure, and baseline expectations that your product wasn't designed around. Suddenly there are too many new variables and you lose the ability to interpret your own data clearly. You also run the risk of neglecting your original user base while chasing a new and unproven audience.

## How Claude can help Launch stage founders

All three forms of Claude are in full use in the Launch stage, and they support each other: each tool produces outputs that become inputs for the other two. The results compound organically, and a founder using all three tools together gets more than the sum of their parts.

This is what makes the ultra-lean startup model structurally possible. When Claude Code builds the product, Claude Cowork builds the company around it, and Claude helps operationalize this product and organizational knowledge, a small team can run like a company nx its size.

### Remediate technical debt before it compounds

Your MVP codebase works, but it also needs a systematic remediation pass in search of any technical debt that could become a structural liability.

First, use Claude Code to run a full architectural audit: identify where the codebase is brittle, any shortcuts that will become expensive to maintain, and where test coverage is thin enough that the next round of feature work will reintroduce the same problems.

Feed Claude Code's audit findings back to Claude to triage and sequence the remediation work: what needs to be fixed before the next release, what can wait a sprint, and what represents acceptable ongoing debt given your current stage. This is also the moment to document the architectural decisions you made during the MVP stage (the ones that lived in your head because there was no time to write them down). Getting them into a CLAUDE.md now ensures that every future Claude Code session starts from a shared understanding of how the system was designed and why.

- **Exercise:** Direct Claude Code to audit your MVP codebase and produce a prioritized list of structural weaknesses, test coverage gaps, and refactoring candidates. Then feed that list to Claude and ask it to sequence the remediation work across your several sprints: any significant issues that you need to address first, things that can be handled in parallel with feature development, and things that can wait.

### Build the systems that replace founder attention

Building the operational systems that free your attention to handle responsibilities only the founder can tackle requires knowing exactly where your attention is going. Use Claude Cowork to run a structured audit of your current operational load, documenting every recurring task, every decision that lands on your desk, and every workflow that only happens because you personally remember to do it. Then have Claude Cowork categorize this inventory into what can be automated entirely, what needs a human but not necessarily you, and what genuinely requires founder judgment.

Once the audit is complete, use Claude Cowork to design the workflow logic for the automation candidates: what triggers each workflow, what the decision rules are, what the output looks like, and where it goes when it's done.

### Make security and compliance a product workstream

Use Claude Code to surface code-level issues that frequently come up in SOC 2, GDPR, or HIPAA audits and standards that your target market requires. This will surface both vulnerabilities and compliance gaps. Feed those findings to Claude to help you prioritize the remediation work and design the controls, audit logging, and access management that enterprise buyers will ask for before they sign. Note: AI scans are an aid but not a substitute for qualified compliance review.

Next, build the compliance workstream into your development cycle rather than running it as a one-time project; compliance documentation needs to be continually maintained and updated. For founders approaching enterprise contracts or international markets, this is also the moment where the Claude Code security scan can help you prepare for an independent security assessment.

- **Exercise:** Run a code-level security review with Claude Code oriented to the frameworks your target market requires. Feed the output to Claude and ask it to produce two things: a prioritized security remediation sequence and a list of the documentation and controls you'll need to produce to satisfy a compliance review from a prospective enterprise buyer.

### Stand up the product management processes you've been skipping

The Launch stage requires a set of lightweight, repeatable processes that can run without requiring founder intervention to trigger or function. Use Claude to design how your product timeline and work cycles will be structured, what a spec needs to include before Claude Code touches a feature, how bug reports get triaged and routed, and what your weekly metrics report covers and how it's distributed.

Once process design is done, use Claude Cowork to build and run the operational layer: scheduling sprint ceremonies, routing incoming bug reports to the right place, compiling weekly metrics from your connected data sources, and maintaining the feedback loop that keeps user signals flowing into product decisions.

- **Exercise:** Ask Claude to design a lightweight product management operating system: a defined sprint cadence, a minimum spec template, a bug triage decision tree, and a weekly metrics brief that pulls from your actual data sources. Then set up Claude Cowork to implement and run the system's recurring operational elements, like scheduling, routing, and report compilation, to happen on schedule without you.
