Fundamentals

What is a skill?

A skill is a folder containing:

•  SKILL.md (required): Instructions in Markdown with YAML frontmatter

Composability

Claude can load multiple skills simultaneously. Your skill should work well 

alongside others, not assume it's the only capability available.

•  scripts/ (optional): Executable code (Python, Bash, etc.)

Portability

•  references/ (optional): Documentation loaded as needed

•  assets/ (optional): Templates, fonts, icons used in output

Core design principles

Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level system:

•  First level (YAML frontmatter): Always loaded in Claude's system prompt. 

Provides just enough information for Claude to know when each skill should 

be used without loading all of it into context.

•  Second level (SKILL.md body): Loaded when Claude thinks the skill is 

relevant to the current task. Contains the full instructions and guidance.

•  Third level (Linked files): Additional files bundled within the skill directory 

Skills work identically across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API. Create a skill once 

and it works across all surfaces without modification, provided the environment 

supports any dependencies the skill requires.

For MCP Builders: Skills + Connectors

💡 Building standalone skills without MCP? Skip to Planning and Design - you can 
always return here later.

If you already have a working MCP server, you've done the hard part. Skills are 

the knowledge layer on top - capturing the workflows and best practices you 

already know, so Claude can apply them consistently.

that Claude can choose to navigate and discover only as needed.

MCP provides the professional kitchen: access to tools, ingredients, and

specialized expertise.

Skills provide the recipes: step-by-step instructions on how to create something 

valuable.

Together, they enable users to accomplish complex tasks without needing to 

figure out every step themselves.

What Claude can do

How Claude should do it

Why this matters for your MCP users

Without skills:

•  Users connect your MCP but don't know what to do next 

•  Support tickets asking "how do I do X with your integration" 

•  Each conversation starts from scratch

•  Inconsistent results because users prompt differently each time

•  Users blame your connector when the real issue is workflow guidance

With skills:

•  Pre-built workflows activate automatically when needed

•  Consistent, reliable tool usage

•  Best practices embedded in every interaction

•  Lower learning curve for your integration

Chapter 2

Planning and design

Start with use cases

Common skill use case categories

Before writing any code, identify 2-3 concrete use cases your skill should enable.

At Anthropic, we’ve observed three common use cases:

Good use case definition:

Category 1: Document & Asset Creation

Use Case: Project Sprint Planning 

presentations, apps, designs, code, etc.

Trigger: User says "help me plan this sprint" or "create 

sprint tasks" 

Steps: 

1. Fetch current project status from Linear (via MCP) 

2. Analyze team velocity and capacity 

3. Suggest task prioritization 

Real example: frontend-design skill (also see skills for docx, pptx, xlsx, and 

ppt)

"Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design 

quality. Use when building web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or 

Used for: Creating consistent, high-quality output including documents, 

4. Create tasks in Linear with proper labels and estimates 

applications."

Result: Fully planned sprint with tasks created

Ask yourself:

•  What does a user want to accomplish?

•  What multi-step workflows does this require?

•  Which tools are needed (built-in or MCP?)

•  What domain knowledge or best practices should be embedded?

Key techniques:

•  Embedded style guides and brand standards

•  Template structures for consistent output

•  Quality checklists before finalizing

•  No external tools required - uses Claude's built-in capabilities

8

Category 2: Workflow Automation 

Define success criteria

Used for: Multi-step processes that benefit from consistent methodology, 

including coordination across multiple MCP servers.

How will you know your skill is working?

Real example: skill-creator skill

"Interactive guide for creating new skills. Walks the user through use case 

definition, frontmatter generation, instruction writing, and validation."

Key techniques:

•  Step-by-step workflow with validation gates

•  Templates for common structures

•  Built-in review and improvement suggestions

•  Iterative refinement loops

Category 3: MCP Enhancement

Used for: Workflow guidance to enhance the tool access an MCP server provides.

Real example: sentry-code-review skill (from Sentry)

"Automatically analyzes and fixes detected bugs in GitHub Pull Requests using 

Sentry's error monitoring data via their MCP server."

Key techniques:

•  Coordinates multiple MCP calls in sequence

•  Embeds domain expertise 

•  Provides context users would otherwise need to specify

•  Error handling for common MCP issues

These are aspirational targets - rough benchmarks rather than precise 

thresholds. Aim for rigor but accept that there will be an element of vibes-based 

assessment. We are actively developing more robust measurement guidance and 

tooling.

Quantitative metrics:

•  Skill triggers on 90% of relevant queries

 – How to measure: Run 10-20 test queries that should trigger your skill. Track 

how many times it loads automatically vs. requires explicit invocation.

•  Completes workflow in X tool calls

 – How to measure: Compare the same task with and without the skill enabled. 

Count tool calls and total tokens consumed. 

•  0 failed API calls per workflow

 – How to measure: Monitor MCP server logs during test runs. Track retry rates 

and error codes.

Qualitative metrics:

•  Users don't need to prompt Claude about next steps

 – How to assess: During testing, note how often you need to redirect or clarify. 

Ask beta users for feedback. 

•  Workflows complete without user correction

 – How to assess: Run the same request 3-5 times. Compare outputs for 

structural consistency and quality.

•  Consistent results across sessions

 – How to assess: Can a new user accomplish the task on first try with minimal 

guidance?

Technical requirements

YAML frontmatter: The most important part

File structure

your-skill-name/

├── SKILL.md              # Required - main skill file

├── scripts/              # Optional - executable code

│   ├── process_data.py # Example

│   └── validate.sh # Example

├── references/           # Optional - documentation

│   ├── api-guide.md # Example

│   └── examples/ # Example

└── assets/              # Optional - templates, etc.

    └── report-template.md # Example

Critical rules

SKILL.md naming:

•  Must be exactly SKILL.md (case-sensitive)

•  No variations accepted (SKILL.MD, skill.md, etc.)

Skill folder naming:

•  Use kebab-case: notion-project-setup ✅

•  No spaces: Notion Project Setup ❌

•  No underscores: notion_project_setup ❌

•  No capitals: NotionProjectSetup ❌

No README.md:

•  Don't include README.md inside your skill folder

•  All documentation goes in SKILL.md or references/

The YAML frontmatter is how Claude decides whether to load your skill. Get this 

right.

Minimal required format

---

name: your-skill-name

description: What it does. Use when user asks to [specific 

phrases].

---

That's all you need to start.

Field requirements

name (required):

•  kebab-case only

•  No spaces or capitals

•  Should match folder name

description (required):

•  MUST include BOTH:
 – What the skill does
 – When to use it (trigger conditions)

•  Under 1024 characters

•  No XML tags (< or >)

•  Include specific tasks users might say

•  Mention file types if relevant

•  Note: when distributing via GitHub, you'll still want a repo-level README for 

human users — see Distribution and Sharing.

10

license (optional):

•  Use if making skill open source

•  Common: MIT, Apache-2.0

compatibility (optional)

•  1-500 characters 

Writing effective skills

The description field

According to Anthropic's engineering blog: "This metadata...provides just 

enough information for Claude to know when each skill should be used without 

loading all of it into context." This is the first level of progressive disclosure.

•  Indicates environment requirements: e.g. intended product, required system 

packages, network access needs, etc.

Structure:

metadata (optional): 

•  Any custom key-value pairs 

•  Suggested: author, version, mcp-server 

•  Example: 

```yaml 

metadata: 

author: ProjectHub 

version: 1.0.0 mcp-server: projecthub 

```

Security restrictions

Forbidden in frontmatter:

•  XML angle brackets (< >)

•  Skills with "claude" or "anthropic" in name (reserved)

Why: Frontmatter appears in Claude's system prompt. Malicious content could 

inject instructions.

[What it does] + [When to use it] + [Key capabilities]

Examples of good descriptions:

# Good - specific and actionable

description: Analyzes Figma design files and generates 

developer handoff documentation. Use when user uploads .fig 

files, asks for "design specs", "component documentation", or 

"design-to-code handoff".

# Good - includes trigger phrases

description: Manages Linear project workflows including sprint 

planning, task creation, and status tracking. Use when user 

mentions "sprint", "Linear tasks", "project planning", or asks 

to "create tickets".

# Good - clear value proposition

description: End-to-end customer onboarding workflow for 

PayFlow. Handles account creation, payment setup, and 

subscription management. Use when user says "onboard new 

customer", "set up subscription", or "create PayFlow account".

11

 
 
Examples of bad descriptions:

# Too vague

description: Helps with projects.

Example:

```bash

python scripts/fetch_data.py --project-id PROJECT_ID

Expected output: [describe what success looks like]

# Missing triggers

description: Creates sophisticated multi-page documentation 

systems.

(Add more steps as needed)

# Too technical, no user triggers

hierarchical relationships.

Example 1: [common scenario]

User says: "Set up a new marketing campaign"

1.  Fetch existing campaigns via MCP 

Recommended structure:

Adapt this template for your skill. Replace bracketed sections with your specific

Clear explanation of what happens.

(Add more examples as needed)

Troubleshooting

Solution: [How to fix]

(Add more error cases as needed)

12

Best Practices for Instructions

Reference bundled resources clearly

Before writing queries, consult `references/api-patterns.md` 

for:

- Rate limiting guidance

- Pagination patterns

- Error codes and handling

Use progressive disclosure

Keep SKILL.md focused on core instructions. Move detailed documentation to 

`references/` and link to it. (See Core Design Principles for how the three-

level system works.)

Be Specific and Actionable

✅  Good:

Run `python scripts/validate.py --input {filename}` to check 

data format.

If validation fails, common issues include:

- Missing required fields (add them to the CSV)

- Invalid date formats (use YYYY-MM-DD)

❌  Bad:

Validate the data before proceeding.

Include error handling

-# Common Issues

--# MCP Connection Failed

If you see "Connection refused":

1. Verify MCP server is running: Check Settings > Extensions

2. Confirm API key is valid

3. Try reconnecting: Settings > Extensions > [Your Service] > 

Reconnect

Testing and iteration

14

Chapter 3

Testing and iteration

Skills can be tested at varying levels of rigor depending on your needs:

Recommended Testing Approach

•  Manual testing in Claude.ai - Run queries directly and observe behavior. Fast 

iteration, no setup required.

Based on early experience, effective skills testing typically covers three areas:

•  Scripted testing in Claude Code - Automate test cases for repeatable 

1. Triggering tests

validation across changes.

•  Programmatic testing via skills API - Build evaluation suites that run 

systematically against defined test sets.

Choose the approach that matches your quality requirements and the visibility 

Goal: Ensure your skill loads at the right times.

Test cases:

•   ✅  Triggers on obvious tasks

of your skill. A skill used internally by a small team has different testing needs 

•   ✅  Triggers on paraphrased requests

than one deployed to thousands of enterprise users.

•   ❌  Doesn't trigger on unrelated topics

Pro Tip: Iterate on a single task before expanding

Example test suite:

Should trigger:

We’ve found that the most effective skill creators iterate on a single challenging 

- "Help me set up a new ProjectHub workspace"

task until Claude succeeds, then extract the winning approach into a skill. This 

- "I need to create a project in ProjectHub"

leverages Claude’s in-context learning and provides faster signal than broad 

testing. Once you have a working foundation, expand to multiple test cases for 

coverage.

- "Initialize a ProjectHub project for Q4 planning"

Should NOT trigger:

- "What's the weather in San Francisco?"

- "Help me write Python code"

- "Create a spreadsheet" (unless ProjectHub skill handles 

sheets)

15

2. Functional tests

Goal: Verify the skill produces correct outputs.

Test cases:

•  Valid outputs generated

•  API calls succeed

•  Error handling works

•  Edge cases covered

Example:

Test: Create project with 5 tasks

Given: Project name "Q4 Planning", 5 task descriptions

When: Skill executes workflow

Then: 

  - Project created in ProjectHub

With skill:

- Automatic workflow execution

- 2 clarifying questions only

- 0 failed API calls

- 6,000 tokens consumed

Using the skill-creator skill

The skill-creator skill - available in Claude.ai via plugin directory or 

download for Claude Code - can help you build and iterate on skills. If you 

have an MCP server and know your top 2–3 workflows, you can build and test a 

functional skill in a single sitting - often in 15–30 minutes.

Creating skills: 

•  Generate skills from natural language descriptions 

  - 5 tasks created with correct properties

•  Produce properly formatted SKILL.md with frontmatter 

  - All tasks linked to project

  - No API errors

•  Suggest trigger phrases and structure 

Reviewing skills: 

•  Flag common issues (vague descriptions, missing triggers, structural 

3. Performance comparison

problems) 

Goal: Prove the skill improves results vs. baseline.

Use the metrics from Define Success Criteria. Here's what a comparison might 

look like.

Baseline comparison:

Without skill:

- User provides instructions each time

- 15 back-and-forth messages

- 3 failed API calls requiring retry

- 12,000 tokens consumed

•  Identify potential over/under-triggering risks 

•  Suggest test cases based on the skill's stated purpose 

Iterative improvement: 

•  After using your skill and encountering edge cases or failures, bring those 

examples back to skill-creator 

•  Example: "Use the issues & solution identified in this chat to improve how the 

skill handles [specific edge case]" 

16

 
 
 
 
To use:

"Use the skill-creator skill to help me build a skill for 

[your use case]"

Execution issues:

•  Inconsistent results

•  API call failures

•  User corrections needed

Note: skill-creator helps you design and refine skills but does not execute 

automated test suites or produce quantitative evaluation results.

Solution: Improve instructions, add error handling

Iteration based on feedback

Skills are living documents. Plan to iterate based on:

Undertriggering signals:

•  Skill doesn't load when it should

•  Users manually enabling it

•  Support questions about when to use it

Solution: Add more detail and nuance to the description - this may include 

keywords particularly for technical terms

Overtriggering signals:

•  Skill loads for irrelevant queries

•  Users disabling it

•  Confusion about purpose

Solution: Add negative triggers, be more specific

Chapter 4

Distribution and sharing

Skills make your MCP integration more complete. As users compare connectors, 

Using skills via API 

those with skills offer a faster path to value, giving you an edge over MCP-only 

alternatives.

For programmatic use cases - such as building applications, agents, or automated 

workflows that leverage skills - the API provides direct control over skill 

Current distribution model (January 2026)

How individual users get skills:

1.  Download the skill folder 

2.  Zip the folder (if needed)

3.  Upload to Claude.ai via Settings > Capabilities > Skills

4. Or place in Claude Code skills directory

Organization-level skills:

management and execution. 

Key capabilities: 

•   `/v1/skills` endpoint for listing and managing skills 

•  Add skills to Messages API requests via the `container.skills` parameter 

•  Version control and management through the Claude Console 

•  Works with the Claude Agent SDK for building custom agents 

When to use skills via the API vs. Claude.ai: 

•  Admins can deploy skills workspace-wide (shipped December 18, 2025)

Positioning your skill

Start by hosting your skill on GitHub with a public repo, clear README (for 

How you describe your skill determines whether users understand its value and 

human visitors — this is separate from your skill folder, which should not contain 

actually try it. When writing about your skill—in your README, documentation, 

a README.md), and example usage with screenshots. Then add a section 

or marketing - keep these principles in mind.

to your MCP documentation that links to the skill, explains why using both 

together is valuable, and provides a quick-start guide.

Focus on outcomes, not features:

1. Host on GitHub

 – Public repo for open-source skills
 – Clear README with installation instructions
 – Example usage and screenshots

2. Document in Your MCP Repo

 – Link to skills from MCP documentation
 – Explain the value of using both together
 – Provide quick-start guide

3. Create an Installation Guide

-# Installing the [Your Service] skill

✅  Good:

"The ProjectHub skill enables teams to set up complete project 

workspaces in seconds — including pages, databases, and 

templates — instead of spending 30 minutes on manual setup."

❌  Bad:

"The ProjectHub skill is a folder containing YAML frontmatter 

and Markdown instructions that calls our MCP server tools."

1. Download the skill:

   - Clone repo: `git clone https:-/github.com/yourcompany/  

Highlight the MCP + skills story:

     skills`

   - Or download ZIP from Releases  

2. Install in Claude:

   - Open Claude.ai > Settings > skills

   - Click "Upload skill"

"Our MCP server gives Claude access to your Linear projects. 

Our skills teach Claude your team's sprint planning workflow. 

Together, they enable AI-powered project management."

Patterns and 
troubleshooting

21

Chapter 5

Patterns and troubleshooting

These patterns emerged from skills created by early adopters and internal teams. 

Pattern 1: Sequential workflow orchestration

They represent common approaches we've seen work well, not prescriptive 

templates. 

Use when: Your users need multi-step processes in a specific order.

Choosing your approach: Problem-first vs. tool-first 

Example structure:

Think of it like Home Depot. You might walk in with a problem - "I need to fix a 

-# Workflow: Onboard New Customer

kitchen cabinet" - and an employee points you to the right tools. Or you might 

pick out a new drill and ask how to use it for your specific job. 

Skills work the same way: 

•  Problem-first: "I need to set up a project workspace" → Your skill orchestrates 

the right MCP calls in the right sequence. Users describe outcomes; the skill 

handles the tools.

•  Tool-first: "I have Notion MCP connected" → Your skill teaches Claude the 

--# Step 1: Create Account

Call MCP tool: `create_customer`

Parameters: name, email, company

--# Step 2: Setup Payment

Call MCP tool: `setup_payment_method`

Wait for: payment method verification

optimal workflows and best practices. Users have access; the skill provides 

--# Step 3: Create Subscription

expertise. 

Most skills lean one direction. Knowing which framing fits your use case helps 

you choose the right pattern below.

Call MCP tool: `create_subscription`

Parameters: plan_id, customer_id (from Step 1)

--# Step 4: Send Welcome Email

Call MCP tool: `send_email`

Template: welcome_email_template

Key techniques:

•  Explicit step ordering

•  Dependencies between steps

•  Validation at each stage

•  Rollback instructions for failures

22

Pattern 2: Multi-MCP coordination

Pattern 3: Iterative refinement

Use when: Workflows span multiple services.

Use when: Output quality improves with iteration.

Example: Design-to-development handoff

Example: Report generation

--# Phase 1: Design Export (Figma MCP)

-# Iterative Report Creation

1. Export design assets from Figma

2. Generate design specifications

3. Create asset manifest

--# Phase 2: Asset Storage (Drive MCP)

1. Create project folder in Drive

2. Upload all assets

3. Generate shareable links

--# Phase 3: Task Creation (Linear MCP)

1. Create development tasks

2. Attach asset links to tasks

3. Assign to engineering team

--# Phase 4: Notification (Slack MCP)

1. Post handoff summary to #engineering

--# Initial Draft

1. Fetch data via MCP

2. Generate first draft report

3. Save to temporary file

--# Quality Check

1. Run validation script: `scripts/check_report.py`

2. Identify issues:

   - Missing sections

   - Inconsistent formatting

   - Data validation errors

--# Refinement Loop

1. Address each identified issue

2. Regenerate affected sections

2. Include asset links and task references

3. Re-validate

4. Repeat until quality threshold met

Key techniques:

•  Clear phase separation

•  Data passing between MCPs

•  Validation before moving to next phase

•  Centralized error handling

--# Finalization

1. Apply final formatting

2. Generate summary

3. Save final version

Key techniques:

•  Explicit quality criteria

•  Iterative improvement

•  Validation scripts

•  Know when to stop iterating

23

Pattern 4: Context-aware tool selection

Pattern 5: Domain-specific intelligence

Use when: Same outcome, different tools depending on context.

Use when: Your skill adds specialized knowledge beyond tool access.

Example: File storage

Example: Financial compliance

-# Smart File Storage

-# Payment Processing with Compliance

--# Decision Tree

1. Check file type and size

2. Determine best storage location:

   - Large files (>10MB): Use cloud storage MCP

--# Before Processing (Compliance Check)

1. Fetch transaction details via MCP

2. Apply compliance rules:

   - Check sanctions lists

   - Collaborative docs: Use Notion/Docs MCP

   - Verify jurisdiction allowances  

   - Code files: Use GitHub MCP

   - Temporary files: Use local storage

   - Assess risk level

3. Document compliance decision

--# Execute Storage

Based on decision:

- Call appropriate MCP tool

- Apply service-specific metadata

- Generate access link

--# Provide Context to User

Explain why that storage was chosen

Key techniques:

•  Clear decision criteria

•  Fallback options

•  Transparency about choices

--# Processing

IF compliance passed:

  - Call payment processing MCP tool

  - Apply appropriate fraud checks

  - Process transaction

ELSE:

  - Flag for review

  - Create compliance case

--# Audit Trail

- Log all compliance checks

- Record processing decisions

- Generate audit report

Key techniques:

•  Domain expertise embedded in logic

•  Compliance before action

•  Comprehensive documentation

•  Clear governance

24

Troubleshooting

Skill won't upload

Error: "Could not find SKILL.md in uploaded folder"

Cause: File not named exactly SKILL.md

Solution:

•  Rename to SKILL.md (case-sensitive)

•  Verify with: ls -la should show SKILL.md

Error: "Invalid frontmatter"

Cause: YAML formatting issue

Common mistakes:

# Wrong - missing delimiters

name: my-skill

description: Does things

# Wrong - unclosed quotes

name: my-skill

description: "Does things

# Correct

---

name: my-skill

description: Does things

---

Error: "Invalid skill name"

Cause: Name has spaces or capitals

# Wrong

name: My Cool Skill

# Correct  

name: my-cool-skill

Skill doesn't trigger

Symptom: Skill never loads automatically

Fix:

Revise your description field. See The Description Field for good/bad examples. 

Quick checklist:

•  Is it too generic? ("Helps with projects" won't work)

•  Does it include trigger phrases users would actually say?

•  Does it mention relevant file types if applicable?

Debugging approach:

Ask Claude: "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" Claude will quote the 

description back. Adjust based on what's missing.

Skill triggers too often

Symptom: Skill loads for unrelated queries

Solutions:

1.  Add negative triggers

description: Advanced data analysis for CSV files. Use for 

statistical modeling, regression, clustering. Do NOT use for 

simple data exploration (use data-viz skill instead).

25

2.  Be more specific

Instructions not followed

# Too broad

description: Processes documents

# More specific

description: Processes PDF legal documents for contract review

3.  Clarify scope

description: PayFlow payment processing for e-commerce. Use 

specifically for online payment workflows, not for general 

financial queries.

MCP connection issues

Symptom: Skill loads but MCP calls fail

Checklist:

1.  Verify MCP server is connected

 – Should show "Connected" status

2.  Check authentication

 – API keys valid and not expired
 – Proper permissions/scopes granted
 – OAuth tokens refreshed

3.  Test MCP independently

 – Ask Claude to call MCP directly (without skill)
 – "Use [Service] MCP to fetch my projects"
 – If this fails, issue is MCP not skill

4. Verify tool names

 – Skill references correct MCP tool names
 – Check MCP server documentation
 – Tool names are case-sensitive

Symptom: Skill loads but Claude doesn't follow instructions

Common causes:

1.  Instructions too verbose

 – Keep instructions concise
 – Use bullet points and numbered lists
 – Move detailed reference to separate files

2.  Instructions buried

 – Put critical instructions at the top
 – Use ## Important or ## Critical headers
 – Repeat key points if needed

3.  Ambiguous language

# Bad

Make sure to validate things properly

# Good

CRITICAL: Before calling create_project, verify:

- Project name is non-empty

- At least one team member assigned

- Start date is not in the past

 Advanced technique: For critical validations, consider bundling a script 

that performs the checks programmatically rather than relying on language 

instructions. Code is deterministic; language interpretation isn't. See the Office 

skills for examples of this pattern.

4. Model "laziness" Add explicit encouragement:

-# Performance Notes

- Take your time to do this thoroughly

- Quality is more important than speed

- Do not skip validation steps

Note: Adding this to user prompts is more effective than in SKILL.md

Large context issues

Symptom: Skill seems slow or responses degraded

Causes:

•  Skill content too large

•  Too many skills enabled simultaneously

•  All content loaded instead of progressive disclosure

Solutions:

1.  Optimize SKILL.md size

 – Move detailed docs to references/
 – Link to references instead of inline
 – Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words

2.  Reduce enabled skills

 – Evaluate if you have more than 20 - 50 skills enabled simultaneously
 – Recommend selective enablement
 – Consider skill "packs" for related capabilities
